UberFarePredictor Project Description:

UberFarePredictor is a machine learning project focused on predicting cab fares using Uber ride data. The repository contains a comprehensive pipeline that covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the evaluation of multiple machine learning models.

Key Components:

Data Cleaning and Exploration:
The project begins with the loading and exploration of Uber ride data, addressing missing values, duplicates, and converting relevant columns to datetime format.

Feature Engineering:
New features such as pickup_month, pickup_day, and pickup_hour are created to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models. Unnecessary columns are dropped to streamline the dataset.

Linear Regression Model:
The linear regression model is employed to establish a baseline for predicting fare amounts. It fits a linear relationship between the features and the target variable, providing a simple yet informative prediction.

Random Forest Model:
The Random Forest model is introduced, leveraging an ensemble of decision trees. This approach enhances predictive accuracy by mitigating overfitting and capturing complex relationships within the data.

Gradient Boosting Model:
The Gradient Boosting model is implemented to further improve prediction performance. It builds an ensemble of weak learners sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor, resulting in a powerful and adaptive predictive model.

Handling Outliers:
Z-scores are computed for fare amounts, and outliers are identified and removed from the dataset. This step ensures a more robust and accurate model training process.

Model Evaluation and Comparison:
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is utilized to evaluate the performance of each model. Comparative analysis of MAE values provides insights into the effectiveness of different models, with and without outlier handling.

Insights and Optimization:
The project concludes with a thorough examination of model performances, offering insights into optimizing fare predictions for transportation datasets. The results guide future model selection and fine-tuning efforts.
